# windows-vulkan-graphics-sub-project
This is a pratice project for windows (win32) - vulkan and for graphics project of 5th semester

Need to setup vulkan yourself, with all paths in visual studio managed by self. 
If not visual studio, do a bit more and need to setup properly.
If not windows , install a virtual machine first then run this.
